# AnDA
Â¡AnDA! is a Python library for the Analog Data Assimilation.

The Matlab code is also provided but will not be supported for the future. We advice new users to consider using the AnDA Python library which does not need special Matlab toolbox licences and is used by the authors in their future works.
